# 42_libft
First project of 42 Paris. (Re)Creating some functions that will be useful later on for the different projects

## How to create libft.a library
Use
```bash
  make
```
To make bonus .o files
```bash
  make bonus
```
Note that this project is up to date with GNL and ft_printf, which are functions that must be created on their own project.
