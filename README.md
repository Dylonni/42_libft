# Libft
The very first project of 42 Paris. (Re)Creating some functions that will be useful later on for the different projects

## How to create libft.a library
Go to the project root's folder , open a terminal and use
```bash
  make
```
To make bonus .o files
```bash
  make bonus
```
Note that this project is up to date with GNL and ft_printf, which are functions that must be created on their own project.
